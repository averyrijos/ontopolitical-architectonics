# Ontopolitical Architectonics: Toward a Unified Theory of World-Making

**A Meta-Theoretical Paradigm for World-Making, Affective Infrastructure, and Mythic Actualization**  
_Avery Alexander Rijos, M.S._

## Abstract

Ontopolitical Architectonics is a meta-cross-paradigm that reconceives reality as malleable architecture — governed not merely by physical laws but by semiotic codes, affective infrastructures, and mythic programs. At its foundation lies the principle that being is governed: all existence is structured by regimes of power that determine what may be felt, thought, or actualized. This theory introduces a ten-axiom stack — ranging from “Myth Is Foundation” to “The Self Is an Architectural Site” — and culminates in a universal ethical law: the maximization of generative capacity, formalized as Good = d(OGI)/dt, where OGI (Ontopolitical Generativity Index) measures a system’s ability to produce novel modes of existence.

Unlike traditional philosophy, this framework is self-reflexive and operational. It includes a recursive design protocol — the O-Loop — that translates critique into redesign, ensuring anti-fragility and evolutionary coherence. It reframes classical dilemmas (such as free will, suffering, and the real/ideal divide) as ontological design problems rather than static paradoxes. By treating imagination as political, absence as fertile, and resistance as architectural, Ontopolitical Architectonics offers not just a lens but a toolset for transforming systems — across policy, economics, identity, and technological design. It calls for a world in which every domain becomes a site of sovereign world-making and where the sacred task of ethics is to build architectures that amplify the dreamable.

## Preliminaries

This essay does not present itself as a research paper in the conventional academic sense. It is not constrained by the methodological austerity of institutional norms, nor does it aim to contribute to a specialized disciplinary literature. Instead, it emerges from the genre of autotheory — a fusion of critical philosophy and lived experience. It speaks from the position of the artist-philosopher: one who inhabits theory not as abstract logic but as a mode of survival, rebellion, and world-construction. What follows is a metaphysical architecture drawn from emotional intuitions, symbolic fragments, and ontological insurgencies. It is a theory that does not merely describe the world but dreams it otherwise. In doing so, it invites the reader not into passive comprehension, but into active participation — to think, to feel, and to design from the thresholds of their own becoming.

## Introduction

Ontopolitical Architectonics proposes that reality is an architectural process shaped by power, narrative, and emotion. It combines ontology (the nature of being) and politics (power structures) into a single framework. According to this paradigm, nothing exists in a vacuum: every entity, emotion, and idea is governed by systemic forces that determine what may be felt, thought, or created. This theory consists of ten core principles (axioms), an overarching law of generative capacity, a reflexive epistemic protocol, and practical implications for resistance and change. Below, we explain each component of this framework.

## Introduction to Axioms

### 1. Being Is Governed: The Political Nature of Existence

Reality is never neutral. Every aspect of what exists is molded by underlying power relations and structures. In Ontopolitical Architectonics, *Being is Governed* means that what can be present in the world — what may exist, be felt, or be imagined — is always determined by some system of power or rule.

- Every entity or state of being (from a species of plant to a scientific theory) emerges within a network of permissions and prohibitions.
- What one community considers a real possibility (e.g. a type of lifestyle, belief, or emotion) may be invisible or forbidden in another due to differing power structures.
- Interrogating reality means asking: Who or what has the authority to say this exists? What is left out or silenced?

In short, Ontopolitical Architectonics begins with the insight that the structure of reality is an architecture built by power. Nothing simply *is* on its own terms; it is permitted by some arrangement of forces.

### 2. Myth Is Foundation: Narrative as Reality-Architecture

Building on this, the framework asserts that narrative shapes reality at the deepest level. *Myth* here does not mean mere ancient fairy tales, but any overarching story, symbol system, or shared fiction that underlies a culture’s understanding of the world.

- Myths determine what we love, believe, fear, and long for; these affective patterns set the boundaries of our perception and possibilities.
- For example, a society that mythologizes “progress” will organize institutions and technologies around ideas of growth and control, making certain futures imaginable and others unimaginable.
- Fiction is a constructive force: the stories we tell ourselves and each other actively build the framework within which the Real emerges.

Changing a society’s dominant myths is akin to changing the foundation of a building: it can open space for new configurations of existence.

---

### 3. Sentience Is Infrastructure: Consciousness as Underlying Structure

Just as myths are foundational, *sentience* — our capacity to sense, feel, and be aware — functions as the deep infrastructure of being. Emotions, perceptions, and states of awareness like joy, grief, longing, and love are not mere private experiences or byproducts; they are collective, political forces that circulate and structure social life. In this framework, to sense is to build.

- Collective moods and states of awareness — hope, fear, outrage — can reshape a political landscape or social movement. This sentient capacity underpins actions and changes in policy or culture.
- An individual’s deep longing or anger, as a conscious force, can manifest in art, protest, or innovation, effectively “designing” new social forms around that sentient impulse.
- Sentience operates at the level of infrastructure: it is embedded in institutions (like therapy or propaganda), technologies (social media algorithms), and cultural norms that guide what and how we sense.

Understanding a society requires mapping its sentient infrastructure — what it privileges or suppresses, and how this shapes collective behavior, perception, and imagination.

### 4. Virtuality Is Real: The Power of Potential

In Ontopolitical Architectonics, the *virtual* (dormant possibilities, unactualized potentials) is treated as just as real as the actual. The virtual is not imaginary; it is the realm of potential that underlies every system.

- An idea not yet implemented or an option not yet chosen still exists as potential.
- Which potentials become actual realities is not pre-determined; it depends on desire, structure, and permission.
- The real world is a subset of the virtual: it is the consequence of which potentials a system allows to actualize and which it suppresses.

Resistance and change often begin in the virtual realm. Recognizing the virtual means seeing that what *could be* is part of what *is*.

---

### 5. Imagination Is Sovereign: Creative World-Making

If the virtual is real, then *imagination* — the faculty by which we engage that potential — is inherently powerful and sovereign.

- Imagination is not escapism; it is the source code for alternative futures.
- Whoever controls or limits the imagination controls the future.
- Restricting imagination is a form of oppression; expanding it is liberation.

---

### 6. Absence Is Generative: The Potential of Emptiness

In this architecture of reality, what is not present is as significant as what is. *Absence* — whether missing voices, silenced histories, or unrealized dreams — is not a void but a wellspring of potential.

- Silence in a narrative suggests untold alternatives.
- Loss and longing fuel invention.
- Gaps in systems can drive new ontologies.

---

### 7. Non-Places Are Thresholds: Liminal Spaces of Change

*Non-places* — zones or states void of fixed identity — are thresholds where the usual rules dissolve and new forms emerge.

- Airports, waiting rooms, grief states, or dream realms are non-places.
- These spaces incubate unexpected encounters, new ideas, and emergent selves.

---

### 8. Resistance Is Redesign: Constructive Opposition

True resistance is not merely negation but construction.

- Critique must be coupled with creation.
- Activism, art, and innovation become world-making acts.

---

### 9. The Self Is an Architectural Site: Constructed Identity

The individual is not fixed but mutable architecture.

- Memories, dreams, cultural narratives — all scaffold identity.
- The self is a non-place: a passage between what was and what can be.

---

### 10. The Task Is Sacred and Systemic: Integrating Practice and Purpose

Changing the architecture of being is both spiritual and systemic.

- Every act of transformation — personal or political — is part of a sacred vocation.
- Each change ripples outward, reshaping the architecture of the world.

---

### 11. Reflexivity Is Immunity: Contradiction as a Catalyst for Evolution

Every critique, contradiction, or rupture is not an attack but an input to be metabolized. *Reflexivity* — the capacity to question and adapt — is a system’s immune response.

- Contradictions are generative forces, not threats.
- Reflexive systems evolve rather than ossify.
- Each wound or challenge becomes information for recalibration.

To be reflexive is to be immunized: negation becomes the seed of new form.
